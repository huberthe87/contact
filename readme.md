A POC of how to implementing an Android application.

## Description

In this project, I've integrated Android Architecture Components as the ViewModel layer to separate the business logic.

I've also demonstrated how to unit test ViewModel and Repository.

The DataSource is an interface that if we want to put it into real production environment we can quickly change the DataSource, so it is scalable to add network or local database implementations.

The UT cases are extremely limited, due the lack of time to consider all the details.
